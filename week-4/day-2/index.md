## Daily JS

### DOM Manipulation

In the current dom, there is an `h2` element with a class of `change-me`.
Write code to make this element say "Hi there Javascript" and have red text.

<h2 class="change-me">Hello HTML</h2>

```js
const hi = document.querySelector(`.change-me`);

hi.innerText = `<em>Hi there Javascript</em>`;
hi.style.color = `red`;
```
