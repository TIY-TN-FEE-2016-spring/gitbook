# Prework Example Projects

> **NOTE** I am currently still working on the prework for the fall class and recommendations and additional resources may change (shouldn't be too drastic).
> To stay up to date on any changes, [star this Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/rtablada/lr-fall-2015/details) and you will get a daily summary of all changes.
> You will will want this for class anyway as this will become a prime source for extra notes and review.
