## Daily JS

The function `replace` takes an array and an item with an `id` property.
Using `reduce`, return a new array where the item with a matching `id` to the passed in item is replaced with the new version.

Example:
  * `arr`: ``[{id: 1, name: `Homer`}, {id: 20, name: `Ned`}, {id: 15, name: `Marge`}]``
  * `item`: ``{id: 20, name: `Maude`}``
Result of `replace(arr, item)`
  * ``[{id: 1, name: `Homer`}, {id: 20, name: `Maude`}, {id: 15, name: `Marge`}]``

```js
function reduce(arr, item) {
  return arr.reduce()
}
```

## Standups

* What is going well?
* What is not going well (what are you struggling with)?
* What's something you'd like to share not about code?
* What's something you've learned

### Common Wins

* Realizing how much we've learned
* Understanding Javascript syntax
* Take Breaks

* There's a lot of things to Javascript
* One missed piece of syntax will break the application
* Backlog
