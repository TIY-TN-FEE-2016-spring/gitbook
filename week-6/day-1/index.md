## Daily JS

The function `replace` takes an array and an item with an `id` property.
Using `reduce`, return a new array where the item with a matching `id` to the passed in item is replaced with the new version.

Example:
  * `arr`: ``[{id: 1, name: `Homer`}, {id: 20, name: `Ned`}, {id: 15, name: `Marge`}]``
  * `item`: ``{id: 20, name: `Maude`}``
Result of `replace(arr, item)`
  * ``[{id: 1, name: `Homer`}, {id: 20, name: `Maude`}, {id: 15, name: `Marge`}]``

```js
function reduce(arr, item) {
  return arr.reduce()
}
```
