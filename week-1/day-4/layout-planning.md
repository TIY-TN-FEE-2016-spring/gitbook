# Breaking Down Layouts

When working with large pages of HTML, it can be hard to decide where to start styling.
By starting to see elements in the browser a bit differently, we can make the task of writing semantic HTML AND the task of styling things much easier.

Let's look at a page design:

<a href="../../img/layouts/stage4.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../img/layouts/stage4.png" alt="Final Design" style="margin: auto; display:block; max-height: 800px;"></a>

At first this is probably overwhelming to try and plan out.
But, if we strip away some of the embellishments (background images, icons, etc) we start to see a bit clearer path for us to style.

<a href="../../img/layouts/stage3.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../img/layouts/stage3.png" alt="Stage 3" style="margin: auto; display:block; max-height: 800px;"></a>

From there, we can continue to strip away detail and see the more general path of how to use things like display and floats, etc.

<a href="../../img/layouts/stage2.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../img/layouts/stage2.png" alt="Stage 2" style="margin: auto; display:block; max-height: 800px;"></a>

Then if we forget about text and only look at the edge of colored backgrounds, we can REALLY see the top level of elements that make up this page.

<a href="../../img/layouts/stage1.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../img/layouts/stage1.png" alt="Stage 1" style="margin: auto; display:block; max-height: 800px;"></a>
