# Day Zero - Install Party

The focus of the install party is to get you comfortable with the shell, make sure we are all up to date with the prework assignments, and to get your Mac ready for class with all the right settings and software installed.

> ** WARNING ** Do not do any of the steps here before the Install Party.
> Not only will it leave you with nothing to do, but it could make things harder to recover if you mess anything up.
