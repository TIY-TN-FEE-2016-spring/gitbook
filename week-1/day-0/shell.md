# Shell/Terminal Review

When working from the terminal there are a few file based commands that are used on a daily basis and you will need to be comfortable using them through the course.

## Common Commands

- `cd`
- `mkdir`
- `touch`
- `open`
- `ls`
- `pwd`
- `mv`
- `cp`
- `rm`
- `echo`
- `less`

## Exit Codes

Usually when we run commands from the terminal, they will automatically exit after doing a bit of work.
We can also run applications from the terminal that run until we tell them to stop.
Other times, there may be an error in a script that makes it hang up.
For these situations, it is vital to know the different ways to send manual exit codes to your shell process.

- `CTRL + C` - Code 130 - Manual exit from script
- `CTRL + D` - End of File
