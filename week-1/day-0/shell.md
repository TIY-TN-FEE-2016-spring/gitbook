# Shell/Terminal Review

When working from the terminal there are a few file based commands that are used on a daily basis and you will need to be comfortable using them through the course.

## Common Commands

- `cd` - Change Directory
- `mkdir` - Make a new Directory
- `touch` - Make a new file
- `open` - Open file or directory with the default program (based on extension)
- `ls` - List all contents of a Directory
- `pwd` - Print current path
- `mv` - Move or rename a file or directory
- `cp` - Copy file or directory
- `rm` - Remove file or directory
- `echo` - Print out some text
- `less` - Open a file in a read only state

## Exit Codes

Usually when we run commands from the terminal, they will automatically exit after doing a bit of work.
We can also run applications from the terminal that run until we tell them to stop.
Other times, there may be an error in a script that makes it hang up.
For these situations, it is vital to know the different ways to send manual exit codes to your shell process.

- `CTRL + C` - Code 130 - Manual exit from script
- `CTRL + D` - End of File
