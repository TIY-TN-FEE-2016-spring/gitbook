# Loopback Reference

## Getting Started

To get started with a JSON API with loopback run:

```
hub clone tiy-tn-fee-2016-spring/base-api <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

This will pull in the base API configured for local development and deployment to heroku.
It also includes basic support for Login and an `end-user` model.
