# HTTP and REST

## What is HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)?

It's how computers talk to each other in the internetz!

Call and Response.

Four Parts of the Request and Response:

* URL - Location of data we are requesting
* Method/Verb - What type of action are we taking
* Headers - Extra info
* Body - Meat of the content

> URL and Method only apply to Requests not Responses
