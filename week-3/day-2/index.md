## Daily JS

### JS Quiz

#### Instructions

Given the code below, write code to make the `digitize` function work.
The function should perform the following:

* Given a non-negative integer, return an array / a list of the individual digits in order.

Slack me a direct message of your attempt.

#### Methods to Look Up

* Number.prototype.toString()
* String.prototype.split

```js
function digitize(n) {
  // Your code goes here
}

console.assert(digitize(123)[0] === 1);
console.assert(digitize(8675309)[6] === 9);
```

## Class & Lab & Homework

### Videos

First watch these videos on a few of the different Array functions that are available (we briefly used `reduce` in the example problem with Credit Cards).

Today while I am out, work on your homework (most of it should be graded up to last night), then read through the resources here in the Gitbook.
I expect for you to have questions and a list of topics that you would like to review or that I need to finish writing here in the Gitbook.
Slack me these in a direct message.
