#### Instructions

Given the code below, write code to make the `digitize` function work.
The function should perform the following:

* Given a non-negative integer, return an array / a list of the individual digits in order.

Slack me a direct message of your attempt.

#### Methods to Look Up

* Number.prototype.toString()
* String.prototype.split

```js
function digitize(n) {
  // Your code goes here
}

console.assert(digitize(123)[0] === 1);
console.assert(digitize(8675309)[6] === 9);
```

## Lab

The designer for exercise 5 realized that they gave you the wrong brand standards.

Replace the values for the new brand standards:

```
$gutter: 1rem;
$haze: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
$brand-primary: #c2185b;
$brand-white: #fdfdfd;
$brand-grey: #8e8e8e;
$brand-light-grey: lighten($brand-grey, 20%);
$brand-border: 0.1rem solid $brand-grey;
$brand-shadow: 0 2px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 2px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
```
