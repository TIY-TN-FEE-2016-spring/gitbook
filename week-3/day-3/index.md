## Daily JS

### JS Quiz

#### Instructions

Given the code below, write code to make the `addNumbers` function work.

The below function does not work.
The variable twoPlusTwo gets set to `undefined`.
Refactor the function to make it work.

Slack me a direct message of your attempt.

```js
function sum(numberA, numberB) {
  return numberA + numberB;
}

var twoPlusTwo = addNumbers(2, 2);

console.assert(twoPlusTwo === 4);
```

## Standups

* What is going well?
* What is not going well (what are you struggling with)?
* What's something you'd like to share not about code?
* What's something you've learned

### Common Wins

* Maybe understand JS better (for some people...)
* JS is going better than we thought
* Layout is getting better
* Revisions and Code Review

### Common Struggles

* Grids and Display (We'll be doing a grid & box model workshop)
* Backlog of Assignments
* Not understanding the problem (need concrete problems)
* JS Syntax is still weird (syntax errors)
* Focus

## Topics

- Debugging
  * Sources Pane
  * `debugger`
- [document.querySelector](query-selector.html)
- [Working with Elements](js-elements.html)
